    <h4>When I am bored, I can easily think of a scenario to create, like group art, scenery pictures, or anything at all. Everything is art, after all :D</h4>
      <h4>Let me share some of my favourite websites and apps for virtual art! My friends and I usually enjoy using IbisPaintX to edit pictures, or as the name suggests, to paint. However, my favourite platform for creating art is Scratch, considering that it has both great vector and bitmap mechanics.</h4>
