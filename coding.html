    <h4>Coding or programming is what I am doing to make this webpage, and it also helps to enhance problem-solving skills and understand technology better.</h4>
    <h4>I found coding interesting since an art class I had in primary school. We got to design anything and create games on Scratch. We also had different coding lessons on robots like Sphero Bolt, it was alot of fun and I have picked up classes on coding since then.</h4>
      <h4>Some platforms I use to code are <a href="https://replit.com/"><span style="color:darkseagreen; font-family:monospace">Replit</span></a>, <a href="https://github.com/"><span style="color:darkseagreen; font-family:monospace">Github</span></a> and <a href="https://studio.code.org/"><span style="color:darkseagreen; font-family:monospace">Code Studio</span></a>.</h4></div>
